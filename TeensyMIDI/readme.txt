# TeensyMIDI
Simple Midi controller that monitors analog inputs to send MIDI on/off, much like an edrum kit.
Uses the Teensyduino 2.0 with a built-in USB module. Once your Arduino IDE is setup to work with Teensyduino, you are ready to use the usbMIDI class.

Can work with custom piezzo sensor or existing edrum pads.
